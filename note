what the thing are working

1. VariableName = Constant

problems at 

1. y = getmem

2. if we already assigned 
    x = 10
   after that we are writing 
    y = x

3.
   y = x + 1
4. 
   y = 1 + x

Language Features :

1>  setMem( [ Variable / DirectValue ] )

2>  VariableName = getmem

3>  Assignment :
       VariableName = Constant
       VariableName = Constant OP VariableName
       VariableName = VariableName OP Constant 

4> In Same Block There should no redeclaration of Variable

5> recursion should have environment to hold current value of variable  

6> Partial Function Support
